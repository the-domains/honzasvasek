First public experiment using my new system of generative choreography. It was interesting to notice that thought the texts are randomly generated some synchronicity is happening. This shows that complex systems with a lot of randomity involved can resonate with life. (Which is why the Tarot works)   
This experiment explores a concept discovered by Tatsumi Hijikata that I learned from Natsu Nakajima:  
"I would like to talk about language and the body. The body is something that cannot be totally captured in words. In the depth of our body, there is something mysterious, something hidden, something that we want to discard. To give these formless matters a form is what Ankoku Butoh is about.  
One of the key elements of Ankoku Butoh, especially Hijikata's Ankoku Butoh, is summed up in this irony: to put into words that which cannot be put into words, to give a form to that which is formless. Perhaps it can also be called the activities of words of the body." -- Natsu Nakajima  
The performance was at IDFX Breda on 13 Dec 2015
