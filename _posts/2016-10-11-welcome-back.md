### What is Butoh?

Butoh is a shamanic performance art. It originated in Japan in the 60's as a rebellion against traditional Japanese theater/dance. It was developed by Hijikata and Ohno. Butoh is a word and like the word Jazz, it is difficult to define what Butoh really is.

Butoh research is a journey into the darkness of the body and the mystery of live.

### You are a computer scientist. How did you get interested in Butoh?

In 2007 I found Butoh by accident. I was living in an artist community in Rotterdam and one of my colleagues asked me to participate in a Butoh piece. The shamanic aspect interested me and I decided to research the subject. In 2011 I spent six months at the Subbody Butoh School in Dharamsala. After that it became a lifestyle.

### Is Butoh a special message that is enjoyed by only a few people?

Butoh performers drop the human condition and cultural programming and work with the body and our feelings, cell memory. We try to dance the whole of existence, so we research and contact our dark side (the shadow, the darkness of the body). Also, I guess this is not for everybody. Quite some of the current Butoh teachers dropped this darkness and teach 'White Butoh', 'The Butoh of Life, etc.

### What kind of training does one have to undergo?

A workshop can give some basics and plant some seeds, but to become a professional Butoh performer takes time. There are only a few places where you can study and practice full time for a longer period, one of them being the SubBody Butoh School in Dharamsala.

### What is a frequently misunderstood facet of Butoh?

The most difficult part of the practice is to get and stay in a state of alternate consciousness, so the spirit can take over and dance the body. Dropping the ego and daily mind is necessary, but it takes a lot of practice before you are really there.
